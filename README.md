An open source project that uses a machine learning based image inpainting methodology to remove watermark from images which is totally indistinguishable from the ground truth version of the image. 

This project was inspired by the [Contextual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07892) (CVPR 2018) and [Gated Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03589) (ICCV 2019 Oral).

And also a shoutout to [Chu-Tak Li](https://chutakcode.wixsite.com/website) for his [Medium article series](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-papers-you-must-read-for-deep-image-inpainting-2e41c589ced0) that really gave me a deep insight into the image inpainting papers stated above
